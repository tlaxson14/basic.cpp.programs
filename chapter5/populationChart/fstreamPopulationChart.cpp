This program will use the fstream STL to read from a doc People.txt
for the year and population over a 100 year period. The output will
show population -- recorded in asterisks -- for every 20 years between
1900 - 2000. Each asterisk represents approximately 1000 people; All
were rounded up to the nearest 1000.
