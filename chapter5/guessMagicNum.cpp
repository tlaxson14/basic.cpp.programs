/************************************************
This program will generate a random number from
1-100 and ask the user to guess the magic number.
The user will guess the number until correct using
the clues provided. After the magic number is
selected, a special message will appear along with
the number of attempts. The user may wish to re-run
the program & attempt to beat their previous score.
