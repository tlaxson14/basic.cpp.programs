/*******************************************************************************
This program will take two inputs from the user and pass the inputs as arguments
to a function. Both inputs are initialized as integer variables, but are passed
by reference, rather the memory addresses of the variables are passed to the
swap function. The swap function will accept the pointer variables for type int
and logically reorder the inputted values to be read in the reverse order they
were inputted. It will do this by dereferencing the pointer variables passed as
arguments to the swap function.
